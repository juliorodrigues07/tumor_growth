abstract = {This paper constitutes a centenary survey of Runge-Kutta methods. It reviews some of the early contributions due to Runge, Heun, Kutta and Nystr√∂m and leads on to the theory of order of accuracy of Runge-Kutta methods, and includes a discussion of implicit methods, stability analysis and methods of error estimation and dense output.}
